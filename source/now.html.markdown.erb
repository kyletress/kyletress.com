# Now 

I retired from skeleton in October 2017. For the first time in 16 years, I'm not sliding headfirst down an ice track at 90 miles per hour all winter. This is great for my physical and mental well-being. I still have ties to skeleton as an athlete representative (and maybe a coach, if the right opportunity comes along), but the time commitment is considerably lower. I'm instead focusing on work and preparing to go back to college next fall.

#### What I'm doing now

- Working for InstaViser and Wirecutter
- Personal programming projects 
- Considering World Cup/Olympic coaching position 
- Athlete representative responsibililies 
- Preparing my college application
- Reading and recommending books

#### What I'm no longer doing

- Skeleton
- Accepting pro bono software work 
- Watching the news 
- Checking voicemail
