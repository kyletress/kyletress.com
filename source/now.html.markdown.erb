# Now 

I retired from skeleton in October 2017. For the first time in 16 years, I'm not sliding headfirst down an ice track at 90 miles per hour all winter. This is great for my physical and mental well-being. I still have ties to skeleton as an athlete representative and coach, but the time commitment is lower.

#### What I'm doing now

- Going to Yale to finish my undergraduate degree
- Working for InstaViser
- Personal programming projects 
- Athlete representative responsibilities 
- Reading and recommending books

#### What I'm no longer doing

- Skeleton
- Watching the news
