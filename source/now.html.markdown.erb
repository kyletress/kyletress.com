# Now 

I retired from skeleton in October 2017. For the first time in 16 years, I'm not sliding headfirst down an ice track at 90 miles per hour all winter. This is great for my physical and mental well-being. I still have ties to skeleton as an athlete representative and coach, but the time commitment is lower.

#### What I'm doing now

- Completing my undergraduate degree at Yale College
- Working for InstaViser
- Personal programming projects 
- Athlete representative responsibililies 
- Reading and recommending books

#### What I'm no longer doing

- Skeleton
- Watching the news
