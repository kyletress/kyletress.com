I'm Kyle Tress. 

I'm an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. I spent 16 years sliding headfirst down an ice track at 90 miles per hour before retiring in October 2017. Now I'm a Rails developer at [InstaViser](https://www.instaviser.com) and a web tester at [Wirecutter](https://www.wirecutter.com).
