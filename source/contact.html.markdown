## How to contact me

I'm trying to use technology in a mindful way; the tradeoff is this makes me a little harder to reach. I don't have a general purpose email address and I rarely use social media. If you'd like to say hello, I'd love to hear from you! Please contact me at: [hello@kyletress.com](mailto:hello@kyletress.com).

### Interviews
I'm occasionally asked to do interviews about the Olympic Games or the sport of skeleton. I enjoy these opportunities, so please get in touch if you'd like to schedule a time to talk: [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com).

### Skeleton advice and coaching
For skeleton advice, please first see my [frequently asked questions](/faqs), and send a message to [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com) if your question isn't answered there. **Note:** I get a lot of these requests, so please be patient.
